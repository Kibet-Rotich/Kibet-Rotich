# 👋 Hi, I’m @Kibet-Rotich

👀 I’m interested in web development, API design, and data analysis. I'm also passionate about cyber security.

🌱 I’m currently learning about RESTful APIs, backend development with Django and Django REST Framework, and cloud computing with Microsoft Azure. I'm also exploring leadership and project management skills for leading teams and NGOs.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web development projects, particularly those involving API integrations.
